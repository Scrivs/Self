            <h1>Hi. My name is Paul Scrivens.</h1>
            <p>I guess the first question you are going to ask is what the hell do I do?</p>
            <p>I build projects and mini-businesses. I know I just coined a new term mini-business which is kind of silly considering <em>small business</em> is already a common term out there.</p>
            <p>For me a mini-business is something that I can build up quickly and run with little maintenance. It&rsquo;s never a passive business because you are always doing something.</p>
            <p>I like to keep all of these projects/mini-businesses under the <a href="https://makersmob.com">Makers Mob</a> umbrella. So if you&rsquo;re ever curious about what I am working on you should always check that site out first.</p>
            <h2>Vitals</h2>
            <p>I currently live in Colorado. I was born August 14, 1980. I&rsquo;m married to a woman that somehow has found a way to tolerate me. I have 3 dogs.</p>
